About LIBGEOTIFF:
-----------------

This library is designed to permit the extraction and parsing of the
"GeoTIFF" Key directories, as well as definition and installation
of GeoTIFF keys in new files. For more information about GeoTIFF
specifications, projection codes and use, see the WWW web page at:

   http://www.remotesensing.com/geotiff/geotiff.html
   
or the FTP archive at:

   ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/geotiff

or the older FTP archive at:

   ftp://ftpmcmc.cr.usgs.gov/release/geotiff/jpl_mirror/


Use of LIBTIFF
--------------

The default configuration assumes that the public-domain LIBTIFF
package for reading and writing TIFF files has been acquired and
built. The latest version of libtiff may be found at:

   ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff
   
and is in compressed tar format. For this build to work you must
use libtiff version v3.4beta018 or newer. Uncompress and untar 
the file, and build the library using the documented methods.

Once the libtiff package has been built, install the "libgeotiff"
directory into the top-level libtiff directory (so that "libgeotiff" is
at the same level as "libtiff").  If libtiff is in some alternate location
it should be possible to set the TIFF_HOME environment variable to point
to the libtiff directory within the distribution, instead of colocating them
before running configure.


Building LIBGEOTIFF:
--------------------


Assuming that whatever TIFF library you use has been built, you
may now build the rest of the geotiff library with:

   % cd libgeotiff
   % ./configure
   % make 

Common Configuration Issues:

 o If you want to alter the compiler used, set the CC environment variable
   before running configure.  

   % setenv CC cc
   % rm config.status
   % ./configure
   % make clean 
   % make 

 o If you want to control the compiler files, set the CFLAGS environment 
   variable.  This can be used to override the default optimization/debug
   flags for instance.

   % setenv CFLAGS -O4
   % rm config.status
   % ./configure
   % make clean 
   % make

 o If the system can't find libtiff, you can use the TIFF_HOME environment
   variable to point to it.

   % setenv TIFF_HOME /contrib/tiff-v3.4beta037/libtiff
   % rm config.status
   % ./configure
   % make clean 
   % make


Test Programs:

There are two demonstration test programs "makegeo" and "listgeo"
that create and list-out the GeoTIFF tags and keys associated 
with a small TIFF file, as well as a full-featured utility called
"geotifcp". These will all be built in the bin/ directory as a matter of 
course, though may require modification if you are not using LIBTIFF, as they
make explicit calls to LIBTIFF for opening the files and setting the
tags. To run them simply call:

  % bin/makegeo
  % bin/listgeo newgeo.tif

to generate and list an example GeoTIFF file. To see the
"geotifcp" utility in action, first call:

  %  bin/listgeo newgeo.tif > metadata.txt
 
to create a GeoTIFF metadata file "metadata.txt", and then

  %  bin/geotifcp  -g  metadata.txt  newgeo.tif  newer.tif
 
to copy the TIFF file newgeo.tif to newer.tif, using the
GeoTIFF metadata as stored in "metadata.txt". See "docs/manual.txt"
for further uses of geotifcp.

To use the new normalization capability of listgeo, the program needs
to be able to find the CSV files.  Use something like the following, 
but indicating the correct path to the CSV directory (libgeotiff/csv). 

  % bin/listgeo -t csv -norm newgeo.tif


 
Non-Standard Configuration:
---------------------------

If you are using a TIFF software package other than libtiff, then you
must override the TIFF file methods used in LIBGEOTIFF. To do this, 
go into directory libgeotiff and edit the files:

    "geo_tiffp.h"
    "geo_tiffp.c"
    
which contain all of the TIFF externals. You will need to define your
own versions of the TIFF tag reading, writing, and memory allocation
calls. See the comments of those two files to see what needs to be
changed. Also, whatever software package you use will have to 
recognize the GeoTIFF tags listed in the include files, and permit
variable-length arrays to be passed in to those tags.
