9602,Geographic/geocentric conversions,1,"Latitude, P, and Longitude, L, in terms of Geographic Coordinate Reference System A may 
be expressed in terms of a geocentric (earth centred) Cartesian coordinate reference system X, Y, Z 
with the Z axis corresponding with the Polar axis positive northwards, the X axis through 
the intersection of the Greenwich meridian and equator, and the Y axis through the 
intersection of the equator with longitude 90 degrees E. If the prime meridian for geogCRS A is not 
Greewich, longitudes must first be transformed to their Greenwich equivalent. If the earth's 
spheroidal semi major axis is a, semi minor axis  b, and inverse flattening 1/f,  then

   XA=   (nu + hA) cos P cos L
   YA=   (nu + hA) cos P sin L
   ZA=  ((1 - e^2) nu + hA) sin P

where nu is the prime vertical radius of curvature at latitude P and is equal to 
   nu = a /(1 - e^2*sin^2(P))^0.5,
   P and L are respectively the latitude and longitude (related to Greenwich) of the point 
   h is height above the ellipsoid, (topographic height plus geoidal height), and
   e is the eccentricity of the ellipsoid where e^2 = (a^2 -b^2)/a^2 = 2f -f^2
                                                                                                                                                 
Cartesian coordinates in geocentric coordinate reference system B may be used to derive geographical coordinates in terms of geographic coordinate reference system B by:
   P   =  arctan (ZB + e^2* nu*sin P) / (XB^2 + YB^2)^0.5 by iteration
   L   = arctan YB/XB
   hB  =  XB sec L sec P  - nu

where LB is relative to Greenwich. If the geographic system has a non Greenwich prime 
meridian, the Greenwich value of the local prime meridian should be applied to longitude.

(Note that h is the height above the ellipsoid. This is the height value which is 
delivered by Transit and GPS satellite observations but is not the topographic 
height value which is normally used for national mapping and levelling operations. 
The topographic height is usually the height above mean sea level or an alternative 
level reference for the country. If one starts with a topographic height,  it will be 
necessary to convert it to an ellipsoid height before using the above transformation 
formulas. h = N + H, where N is the geoid height above the ellipsoid at the point 
and is sometimes negative, and H is the height of the point above the geoid. The 
height above the geoid is often taken to be that above mean sea level, perhaps with 
a constant correction applied. Geoid heights of points above the nationally used 
ellipsoid may not be readily available. For the WGS84 ellipsoid the value of N, 
representing the height of the geoid relative to the ellipsoid, can vary between 
values of -100m in the Sri Lanka area to +60m in the North Atlantic.)","Consider a North Sea point with coordinates derived by GPS satellite in the WGS 84 geographical coordinate system with coordinates of:

    and ellipsoidal height 73.0m, 

whose coordinates are required in terms of the ED50 geographical coordinate system which takes the International 1924 ellipsoid. The three parameter datum shift from WGS 84 to ED50 for this North Sea area is given as dX = +84.87m, dY = +96.49m, dZ = +116.95m.

   YB =   140 349.83m
   ZB = 5124 421.30m

9605,Abridged Molodenski,1,"As an alternative to the computation of the new latitude, longitude and height above ellipsoid in discrete steps through geocentric coordinates, the changes in these geographic coordinates may be derived directly by formulas derived by Molodenski. Abridged versions of these formulas, which are quite satisfactory for three parameter transformations, are as follows:

dlat "" = [(-dX*sin(lat)*cos(lon)) - (dY*sin(lat)*sin(lon)) + (dZ*cos(lat)) + (((a*Df) + (f*Da))*sin(2*lat))] / (rho * sin(1""))

dh = (dX*cos(lat)*cos(lon)) + (dY*cos(lat)*sin(lon)) + (dZ*sin(lat)) + ((a*Df + f*Da)*(sin(lat)^2)) - da

where the dX, dY and dZ terms are as before, and rho and nu are the meridian and prime vertical radii of curvature at the given latitude (lat) on the first ellipsoid, da is the difference in the semi-major axes (a1 - a2) of the first and second ellipsoids and df  is the difference in the flattening of the two ellipsoids.

The formulas for dlat and dlon indicate changes in latitude and longitude in arc-seconds.","For a North Sea point with coordinates derived by GPS satellite in the WGS84 geographical coordinate reference system, with coordinates of:

9606,Position Vector 7-param. transformation,1,"Transformation of coordinates from one geographic coordinate reference system into another (also known as a ""datum transformation"") is usually carried out as an implicit concatenation of three transformations:
[geographical to geocentric >> geocentric to geocentric >> geocentric to geographic]

The middle part of the concatenated transformation, from geocentric to geocentric, is usually described as a simplified 7-parameter Helmert transformation, expressed in matrix form with 7 parameters, in what is known as the ""Bursa-Wolf"" formula:

   (Xt)             (  1       -Rz    +Ry)      (Xs)     (dX)
   (Yt)  =  M *  ( +Rz      1      -Rx)  *  (Ys)  + (dY)
   (Zt)              ( -Ry   +Rx       1 )      (Zs)      (dZ)

The parameters are commonly referred to defining the transformation ""from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system"", whereby (Xs, Ys, Zs) are the coordinates of the point in the source geocentric coordinate reference system and (Xt, Yt, Zt) are the coordinates of the point in the target geocentric coordinate reference system.  But that does not define the parameters uniquely; neither is the definition of the parameters implied in the formula, as is often believed.  However, the following definition, which is consistent with the “Position Vector Transformation” convention is common E&P survey practice, 

(dX, dY, dZ)   :Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source system to target system; also: the coordinates of the origin of the source coordinate reference system in the target coordinate reference system.

(Rx, Ry, Rz)   :Rotations to be applied to the point's vector.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the position vector when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis; e.g. a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source system to target system will result in a larger longitude value for the point in the target system.  Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

M                  :The scale correction to be made to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to obtain the correct scale in the target coordinate reference system. M = (1 + dS*10^-6), where dS is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.

9607,Coordinate Frame rotation,1,"<<<<<This text is continued from the description of the Position Vector Transformation formula>>>>>

Although being common practice particularly in the European E&P industry, the Position Vector Transformation sign convention is not universally accepted.  A variation on this formula is also used, particularly in the USA E&P industry.  That formula is based on the same definition of translation and scale parameters, but a different definition of the rotation parameters.  The associated convention is known as the ""Coordinate Frame Rotation"" convention (EPSG coordinate operation method code 9607). 
The formula is:

   (X’)             (  1      +Rz      -Ry)     (X)      (dX)
   (Y’)  =  M *  ( -Rz       1      +Rx)  * (Y)  +  (dY)
   (Z’)              ( +Ry   -Rx        1 )     (Z)       (dZ)

and the parameters are defined as:

(dX, dY, dZ)   : Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system; also: the coordinates of the origin of source coordinate reference system in the target frame.

(Rx, Ry, Rz)   : Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

M                  : The scale factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system  in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS*10^-6), where dS is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.

In the absence of rotations the two formulas are identical; the difference is solely in the rotations. The name of the second method reflects this.

Note that the same rotation that is defined as positive in the first method is consequently negative in the second and vice versa.  It is therefore crucial that the convention underlying the definition of the rotation parameters is clearly understood and is communicated when exchanging datum transformation parameters, so that the parameters may be associated with the correct coordinate transformation method (algorithm).","The same example as for the Position Vector Transformation (coordinate operation method 9606) can be calculated, however the following transformation parameters have to be applied to achieve the same input and output in terms of coordinate values:

The similarity transformation can also be described as a special case of the parametric affine transformation where coefficients A1 = B2  and  A2 =  - B1.

Reversibility
In contrast with the affine transformation, the similarity transformation parameters are reversible, but only on the condition that the scale difference between the two coordinate systems is small (order of several parts per million).  Then dS is the deviation from unity of the ratio of the units of measure of the two coordinate reference systems. In these cases the reverse transformation would require a scale correction of 1/(1+dS) * (1-dS).  This enables usage of the same scale and rotation parameters, but with reversed sign, for the reverse transformation. (The rotation angle of +q becomes –q, which is valid for all q).   However for the reverse transformation the translation parameters, XT0’ and YT0’, take entirely different values.

The two axes are orthogonal, but the unit on the I-axis is 25 metres, whilst the unit on the J-axis is 12.5 metres.
The target projected coordinate system is WGS 84 / UTM Zone 31N and the origin of the bin grid (centre of bin 0,0) is defined at E = 456781.0, N = 5836723.0.  The projected coordinate system point scale factor at the bin grid origin is 0.99984.
The map grid bearing of the I and J axes are 110* and 20* respectively.  Thus the angle through which both the positive I and J axes need to be rotated to coincide with the positive Easting axis and Northing axis respectively is +20 degrees.

The transformation involves the following sequence of steps:
·  Selection of a subset of the geoid file covering the extent of the points to be transformed.
·  If the geoid file is not based on the source or target CRS, it needs to be transformed first. This involves transformation of the chosen subset of the geoid file from its orignal Geographic 3D CRS to the Geographic 3D CRS that is the source or the target of this transformation.

(Rx, Ry, Rz)   : Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

(Xp, Yp, Zp)   : Coordinates of the point about which the coordinate reference frame is rotated, given in the source Cartesian coordinate reference system. 

M                  : The scale factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system  in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS*10^-6), where dS is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.

Reversibility.
The Molodensky-Badekas transformation in a strict mathematical sense is not reversible, i.e. in principle the same parameter values cannot be used to execute the reverse transformation. This is because the evaluation point coordinates are in the forward direction source coordinate reference system and the rotations have been derived about this point. They should not be applied about the point having the same coordinate values in the target coordinate reference system, as is required for the reverse transformation. However, in practical application there are exceptions when applied to the approximation of small differences between the geometry of a set of points in two different coordinate reference systems. The typical vector difference in coordinate values is in the order of 6*10^1 to 6*10^2 metres, whereas the evaluation point on or near the surface of the earth is 6.3*10^6 metres from the origin of the coordinate systems at the Earth’s centre. This difference of four or five orders of magnitude allows the transformation in practice to be considered reversible. Note that in the reverse transformation, only the signs of the translations and rotation parameter values are reversed; the coordinates of the evaluation point remain unchanged.",,,EPSG guidance note #7.,EPSG,2001-11-06 00:00:00,2002.51,0

Hence an evaluation point is chosen in the source coordinate reference system (XS0, YS0) and in the target coordinate reference system (XT0, YT0).

For areas south of the equator the value of latitude lat will be negative and the formulas above, to compute the E and N,  will automatically result in the correct values. Note that the false northings of the origin, if the equator, will need to be large to avoid negative northings and for the UTM projection is in fact 10,000,000m. Alternatively, as in the case of Argentina's Transverse Mercator (Gauss-Kruger) zones, the origin is at the south pole with a northings of zero. However each zone central meridian takes a false easting of 500000m prefixed by an identifying zone number. This ensures that instead of points in 
different zones having the same eastings, every point in the country, irrespective of its projection zone, will have a unique set of projected system coordinates. Strict application of the above formulas, with south latitudes negative, will result in the derivation of the correct Eastings and Northings. 

Similarly, in applying the reverse formulas to determine a latitude south of the equator, a negative sign for lat results from a negative lat1 which in turn results from a negative M1.","For Projected Coordinate System OSGB 1936 / British National Grid

Here the coordinate axes are called Westings and Southings and increment to the West and South from the origin respectively.  The standard Transverse Mercator formulas (coordinate operation method code 9807) need to be modified to cope with this arrangement with

Westing, W = FE - k0 nu[A + (1 - T + C)A^3/6 + (5 - 18*T + T^2 + 72*C - 58*e'^2)A^5/120]

Southing, S = FN - k0{M - M0 + nu*tan(lat)*[A^2/2 + (5 - T + 9*C + 4*C^2)A^4/24 + (61 - 58*T + T^2 + 600*C - 330*e'^2)A^6/720]}

In these formulas the terms FE and FN retain their definition, i.e. in the Transverse Mercator (South Orientated) method they increase the Westing and Southing value at the natural origin. In this method they are effectively false westing (FW) and false southing (FS) respectively.

For the reverse formulas, those for the standard Transverse Mercator above apply, with the exception that:

M1 = M0 - (S - FN)/k0

9809,Oblique Stereographic,1,"Given the geodetic origin of the projection at the tangent point (lat0, lon0), the parameters defining the conformal sphere are:

R= sqrt( rho0 * nu0)
n= {1 + [e^2 * cos^4(latC) / (1 - e^2)]}^0.5
c=  [(n+sin(lat0)) (1-sin(chi0))]/[(n-sin(lat0)) (1+sin(chi0))]

where:
sin(chi0) = (w1-1)/(w1+1)
w1 = (S1.(S2)^e)^n
S1 = (1+sin(lat0))/(1-sin(lat0))
S2 = (1-e sin(lat0))/(1+e sin(lat0))

The conformal latitude and longitude (chi0,lambda0) of the origin are then computed from :

chi0 = asin[(w2-1)/(w2+1)]

where S1 and S2 are as above and  w2 = c (S1(S2)^e)^n
 
lambda0  = lon0

For any point with geodetic coordinates (lat, lon) the equivalent conformal latitude and longitude (chi, lambda) are computed from 
lambda = n(lon-lambda0) + lambda0
chi = asin[(w-1)/(w+1)]

where w = c (Ss (Sb)^e)^n
Sa = (1+sin(lat))/(1-sin(lat))
Sb = (1-e.sin(lat))/(1+e.sin(lat))
 
Then B = [1+sin(chi) sin(chi0) + cos(chi) cos(chi0) cos(lambda-lambda0)]

N = FN + 2 R k0 [sin(chi) cos(chi0) - cos(chi) sin(chi0) cos(lambda-lambda0)] / B

E = FE + 2 R k0 cos(chi) sin(lambda-lambda0) / B


The reverse formulae to compute the geodetic coordinates from the grid coordinates involves computing the conformal values, then the isometric latitude and finally the geodetic values.

The parameters of the conformal sphere and conformal latitude and longitude at the origin are computed as above. Then for any point with Stereographic grid coordinates (E,N) :

chi = chi0 + 2 atan[{(N-FN)-(E-FE) tan (j/2)} / (2 R k0)]

lambda = j + 2 i + lambda0

where g = 2 R k0 tan(pi/4 - chi0/2)
h = 4 R k0 tan(chi0) + g
i = atan[(E-FE) / {h+(N-FN)}]
j = atan[(E-FE) / (g-(N-FN)] - i

Geodetic longitude lon = (lambda-lambda0 ) / n +  lambda0

Isometric latitude psi = 0.5 ln [(1+ sin(chi)) / { c (1-  sin(chi))}] / n

First approximation lat1 = 2 atan(e^psi)  - pi/2  where e=base of natural logarithms.

psii = isometric latitude at lati

where psii= ln[{tan(lati/2 + pi/4}  {(1-e sin(lati))/(1+e sin(lati))}^(e/2)]
 
Then iterate lat(i+1) = lati - ( psii - psi ) cos(lati) (1 -e^2 sin^2(lati)) / (1 - e^2)

until the change in lat is sufficiently small.

For Oblique Stereographic projections centred on points in the southern hemisphere,  the signs of E, N, lon0, lon,  must be reversed to be used in the equations and lat will be negative anyway as a southerly latitude.

An alternative approach is given by Snyder, where, instead of defining a single conformal sphere at the origin point, the conformal latitude at each point on the ellipsoid is computed.  The conformal longitude is then always equivalent to the geodetic longitude.  This approach is a valid alternative to the above, but gives slightly different results away from the origin point. It is therefore considered by EPSG to be a different coordinate operation method to that described above.","For Projected Coordinate System RD / Netherlands New

From this tabulation in which geographical coordinates are given to 5 decimal places it can be seen that:
a)  the minimum easting is 94 km, on which the longitude is 5.68989 grads east of Paris.
b)  the maximum easting is 490 km, on which the longitude is 10.51515 grads east of Paris.
c)  each 2 km grid easting interval equals 0.02437 grads.
d)  the minimum northing is 40 km, on which the latitude is 33.39 grads.
e)  the maximum northing is 860 km, on which the latitude is 41.6039 grads.
f)  between 40 km N and 360 km N, each 2 km grid northing interval equals 0.02004 grads.
g)  between 360 km N and 860 km N, each 2 km grid northing interval equals 0.02003 grads.

Grads from Paris

where N is in kilometres and A = 0.010015 if N > 360, else A = 0.01002.

LonParis (grads) = 7.83445 + [(E - 270) * 0.012185], where E is in kilometres.

The reverse formulae are:

where Lat is in grads and B = 0.010015  if  lat>36.5964, else B = 0.01002.

Degrees from Greenwich.

Modern practice in Tunisia is to quote latitude and longitude in degrees with longitudes referenced to the Greenwich meridian.  The formulae required in addition to the above are:

Lat (degrees) =  (Latg * 0.9) where Latg is in grads.
LonGreenwich (degrees) = [(LonParis + 2.5969213) * 0.9] where LonParis is in grads.


Lat (grads) =  (Latd / 0.9) where Latd is in decimal degrees.
LonParis (grads) = [(LonGreenwich / 0.9) - 2.5969213)] where LonGreenwich is in decimal degrees.","For grid location 302598,
