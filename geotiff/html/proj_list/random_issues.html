<h1>Random Outstanding Issues</h1>

Various outstanding issues with these projections, EPSG, GeoTIFF, PROJ.4
and OpenGIS in no particular order.  This is also not a comprehensive list
of outstanding issues.<p>

<h2><a name="stereographic">Stereographic</a></h2>

<ol>
<li> Are Stereographic, Polar Stereographic, and Oblique Stereographic 
really all the same projection?

<li> Is the latitute of natural origin for Polar Stereographic required
to be 90 or -90?  Shouldn't this be mentioned?

<li> Shouldn't all the sterographic projections include a scale at the
origin?

<li> Why does the EPSG tables have a scale for Oblique Stereographic, but
the (old) GeoTIFF definition doesn't?

<li> Why do the GeoTIFF parameters have such variable names for the different
stereographic projections?  PS uses StraightVertPoleLong and NatOriginLat, 
OS uses NatOrigin, and Stereographic uses ProjCenterLat/Long. 

<li> In PJ_stere.c for PROJ.4 in function INVERSE(e_inverse) the calculation
of phi_l should likely test for a rho of zero (at the origin when xy.x and xy.y
are zero. Verify doing an inverse translation of position (0,0) with 
pci_eg/sg.tif.

<pre>
  if( rho == 0.0 )
    phi_l = asin(cosphi * P->sinX1);
  else
    phi_l = asin(cosphi * P->sinX1 + (xy.y * sinphi * P->cosX1 / rho));
</pre>

<li> The PCI ps.tif file has a ProjNatOriginLatGeoKey.  In PCI's PROJ.HLP
this number is called the latitude of true scale, but it carried through
to PROJ.4 as the +lat_0 value, not as +lat_ts (which it should perhaps be). 
The Intergraph stereo_np.tif file has two lattitudes.  One is the 
ProjNatOriginLatGeoKey and the other is ProjCenterLatGeoKey.  I imagine
that the ProjScaleAtNatOriginGeoKey and ProjNatOriginLatGeoKey are really
supposed to be equivelent to giving a latitude of true scale that isn't
the north pole (necessarily) if the scale is 1.0.<p>

The current formulation includes a scale at the origin, but suggests
that the origin must be either the north or south pole.  Perhaps this is
mixing up use of ProjCenterLatGeoKey to mark the pole with the use of
an origin to establish the position of true scale (or alternatively to 
just give the scale at the origin).  Is the solution to provide two 
formulations of polar stereographic, or to expect translators to boil
their internal forumulations down to a pole indicator, and scale at the
pole?<p>

</ol>

<h2>ObliqueMercator</h2>

The EPSG definition of Oblique Mercator includes an angle from rectified
to skewed grid.  This isn't included for GeoTIFF, and doesn't appear to 
be supported by any system I have seen.  Is this equivelent to what Peter
Laskowski calls pre or post transformation rotation (that could be applied
to most projections)?<p>

<h2>Polyconic</h2>

Should Polyconic use NatOriginLat/Long, or ProjCenterLat/Long?  Different
vendors do different things.  I have indicated NatOrigin in the
<a href="polyconic.html">Polyconic</a> definition, but this is at odds
with previous thoughts on geotiff-l, and the implementations of some
companies. <p>

<h2>Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>

The PCI and PROJ.4 results for reprojection don't match very closely
with the PCI ae.tif sample:<p>

<pre>
PCI:
Upper Left  Corner             :    117d38'28.22" W  Lon   33d54'13.08" N  Lat

gdalinfo:
Origin (long/lat) = (-117.641,33.904) (117d38'26.91"W,  33d54'14.34"N)
</pre>

This amounts to approximately sixty meters of error in about 20000 meters. 
I don't know if this is a fundamental difference between GCTP and PROJ.4 
or what.  This should be reviewed at some point.<p>

<h2>Miller Cylindrical</h2>

The PCI (GCTP) and PROJ.4 results for this projection are also not
matching very closely.  It appears to be a problem similar to the above.
<p>

<pre>
PCI:
 Upper Left  Corner             :    117d38'28.21" W  Lon   33d54'13.08" N  Lat

gdalinfo:
 Origin (long/lat) = (-117.641,33.8682) (117d38'27.53"W,  33d52'5.42"N)
</pre>

<h2><a name="robinson">Robinson</a></h2>

The PCI (GCTP) and PROJ.4 results for this projection are also not
matching very closely.  It appears to be a problem similar to the above.
The problem might relate to the distance from the origin but this is
commonly used as a world projection, so I am surprised at the huge
difference (6 degrees in ns direction!)<p>

<pre>
PCI:
 Upper Left  Corner             :    117d38'28.21" W  Lon   33d54'13.08" N  Lat

gdalinfo:
  Origin (long/lat) = (-117.672,39.2717) (117d40'20.81"W,  39d16'18.19"N)
</pre>

I gather from the GCTP and PROJ.4 documentation that Robinson is only available
as a spherical projection, and yet above was used with Clark 1866, which is
not spherical.  I would suggest that the problem might relate to different
handling of non-spherical worlds, but this shouldn't account for the large
difference.  In general shouldn't we be keeping track of spherical projections
and warning of use of non-spherical ellipsoids?<p>

<h2><a name="equirectangular">Equirectangular</a></h2>

The PCI (GCTP) and PROJ.4 results for this projection are also not
matching very closely.  It appears to be a problem similar to the above.

 Origin (long/lat) = (-117.641,33.8653) (117d38'27.53"W,  33d51'55.12"N)
</pre>

<h2><a name="gnomonic">Gnomonic</a></h2>

The PCI (GCTP) and PROJ.4 results for this projection are also not
matching very closely.  It appears to be a problem similar to the above.

</pre>

<h2><a name="laea">Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area</a></h2>

The PCI (GCTP) and PROJ.4 results for this projection are also not
matching very closely.  It appears to be a problem similar to the above.
<p>

<pre>
PCI:
 Upper Left  Corner             :    117d38'28.22" W  Lon   33d54'13.08" N  Lat

</pre>

<b>A more detailed examination suggests that GCTP always uses a radius
of 6370997 (E019 - Normal Sphere) for spherical projections.  For at least
LAEA the PROJ.4 and GCTP results were the same if the PROJ.4 radius was
overridden to be 6370997 - I would need to verify that this is true of
other problems above as well.</b><p>
