<h3>EPSG Notes</h3>

For the mapping of southern Africa a south oriented Transverse Mercator projection is 
used. Here the coordinate axes are called Westings and Southings and increment to the 
West and South from the origin respectively.  The Transverse Mercator formulas need to 
be modified to cope with this arrangement with<p>
<pre>
	Westing, W = k0 *[A + (1 - T + C)A3/6 + (5 - 18T + T2 + 72C - 58e'2)A5/120] - 
FE

	Southing, S = k0{M - M0 + *tan*[A2/2 + (5 - T + 9C + 4C2)A4/24 + 
				(61 - 58T + T2 + 600C - 330e'2)A6/720]}- FN
</pre>
In these formulas the terms FE and FN have been retained for consistency of the
terminology.  For the reverse formulas, those for the standard Transverse 
Mercator above apply, with the exception that:<p>

<pre>
	M1 = M0 + (S + FN)/k0
and	D = (W + FE)/(*1k0), with *1 = * for *1
</pre>
