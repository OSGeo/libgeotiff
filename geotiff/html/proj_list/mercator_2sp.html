<h3>Notes</h3>

From the EPSG notes:<p>
<i>
The difference between 1SP and 2SP formulations is that the initial 
parameters are different: in 1SP
you start from the longitude of natural origin and the scale factor,
while in 2SP you start from the longitude of natural origin and the
latitude of one of the standard parallels (the other is symmetrical
in relation to the equator). So, the formulas of 2SP are just those
for 1SP after calculating the scale factor from the absolute value of
the latitude of the standard parallels and the "e" parameter of the
datum.</i><p>


<h3>PROJ.4 Organization</h3>

PROJ.4 does not support a latitude of natural origin other than the equator.

<h3>EPSG Notes</h3>

Mercator<p>
	
The Mercator projection is a special case of the Lambert Conic Conformal projection  
with the equator as the single standard parallel. All other parallels of latitude are straight 
lines and the meridians are also straight lines at right angles to the equator, equally spaced. 
It is little used for land mapping purposes but is in universal use for navigation charts and 
is the basis for the transverse and oblique forms of the Mercator. As well as being 
conformal, it has the particular property that straight lines drawn on it are lines of constant 
bearing. Thus navigators may derive their course  from the angle the straight course line 
makes with the meridians.<p>

In the few cases in which the Mercator projection is used for terrestrial applications or 
land mapping, such as in Indonesia prior to the introduction of the Universal Transverse 
Mercator, a scale factor may be applied to the projection. This has the same effect as 
choosing two standard parallels on which the true scale is maintained at equal north and 
south latitudes either side of the equator.<p>

The formulas to derive projected Easting and Northing coordinates are:
<p>

<pre>
For the two standard parallel case, k0 is first calculated from

k0 = cos*1/(1 - e2sin2*1)1/2 
 
where *1 is the absolute value of the first standard parallel (i.e. positive).  

Then, for both one and two standard parallel cases, 

	E = FE + ak0(* - *0)              
	N = FN + ak0 logn{tan(*/4 + */2)[(1 - esin*) / (1 + esin*)]e/2 }                    
           		where symbols are as listed above and logarithms are natural.
	
The reverse formulas to derive latitude and longitude from E and N values are:
	
	* = * + (e2/2 + 5e4/24 + e6/12 + 13e8/360) sin(2*) 
		+ (7e4/48 + 29e6/240 + 811e8/11520) sin(4*)
		+ (7e6/120 +  81e8/1120) sin(6*)  + (4279e8/161280) sin(8*)

where 		* = */2 - 2 arctan t
		t = B (FN-N)/(ak0)   	
		B = base of the natural logarithm, 2.7182818...
		and  for the 2 SP Case, k0 is calculated as for the forward transformation 
above.

Parameters:
Ellipsoid  Krassowski 1940   a = 6378245.00m   1/f = 298.300
then e = 0.08181333 and e^2 = 0.00669342

Latitude first SP                             42o00'00""N = 0.73303829 rad
Longitude Natural Origin                51o00'00""E = 0.89011792 rad
False Eastings FE                          0.00 m
False Northings (at equator) FN     0.00 m
  
then natural origin at latitude of 0oN has scale factor k0=  0.74426089

Forward calculation for: 
Latitude        53o00'00.00""N = 0.9250245 rad
Longitude     53o00'00.00""E  = 0.9250245 rad

gives Easting E   =     165704.29 m 
          Northing N =   5171848.07 m

Reverse calculation for same easting and northing first gives :
t = 0.33639129    chi = 0.92179596

Then Latitude     =  53o00'00.000""N
          Longitude  =  53o00'00.000""E"
