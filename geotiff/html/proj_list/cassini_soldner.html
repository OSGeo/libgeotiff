<h3>Notes</h3>

The Intergraph sample files include a non 1.0 scale at the natural origin;
however, this isn't currently an official part of the spec.  However, if you
can handle a scale parameter, you should look for ScaleAtNatOrigin. <p>

There does not appear to be any scaling support with PROJ.4's Cassini.  
The documentation for PROJ.4 just calls the projection Cassini, but does
indicate support for ellipical as well as spherical forms so I presume it
is the same as Cassini-Soldner.<p>

Cassini-Soldner Formula<p>

The Cassini-Soldner projection is the ellipsoidal version of the Cassini projection for the 
sphere. It is not conformal but as it is relatively simple to construct it was extensively used 
in the last century and is still useful for mapping areas with limited longitudinal extent. It 
has now largely been replaced by the conformal Transverse Mercator which it resembles. 
Like this, it has a straight central meridian along which the scale is true, all other meridians 
and parallels are curved, and the scale distortion increases rapidly with increasing distance 
from the central meridian.<p>

The formulas to derive projected Easting and Northing coordinates are:<p>
<pre>
	Easting, E = FE + *[A - TA3/6 -(8 - T + 8C)TA5/120]

	Northing, N = FN + M - M0 + *tan*[A2/2 + (5 - T + 6C)A4/24]		

where	A = (* - *0)cos*
	T = tan2*
	C = e2 cos2*/(1 - e2) 
and M, the distance along the meridian from equator to latitude *, is given by
	M = a[1 - e2/4 - 3e4/64 - 5e6/256 -....)* - (3e2/8 + 3e4/32 + 45e6/1024 +....)sin2* 
		+ (15e4/256 + 45e6/1024 +.....)sin4* - (35e6/3072 + ....)sin6* + .....]
with * in radians.

M0 is the value of M calculated for the latitude of the chosen origin. This may not 
necessarily be chosen as the equator.

To compute latitude and longitude from Easting and Northing the reverse formulas are:
	* = *1 - (*1tan*1/*1)[D2/2 - (1 + 3T1)D4/24]
	* =  *0 + [D - T1D3/3 + (1 + 3T1)T1D5/15]/cos*1

where	*1 is the latitude of the point on the central meridian which has the same Northing 
as the point whose coordinates are sought, and is found from:

	*1 = *1 + (3e1/2 - 27e13/32 +.....)sin2*1 + (21e12/16 - 55e14/32 + ....)sin4*1
		+ (151e13/96 +.....)sin6*1 + (1097e14/512 - ....)sin8*1 + ......
where
	e1 = [1- (1 - e2)1/2]/[1 + (1 - e2)1/2]
	*1 = M1/[a(1 - e2/4 - 3e4/64 - 5e6/256 - ....)]
	M1 = M0 + (N - FN)
	T1 = tan2*1
	D = (E - FE)/*1","For Projected Coordinate System Trinidad 1903 / Trinidad Grid
