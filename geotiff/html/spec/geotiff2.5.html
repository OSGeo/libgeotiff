 <h3><a name="2.5">2.5 Coordinate Systems in GeoTIFF</a></h3>
<tt>Geotiff has been designed so that standard map coordinate system
definitions can be readily stored in a single registered TIFF tag. It has also
been designed to allow the description of coordinate system definitions which
are non-standard, and for the description of transformations between coordinate
systems, through the use of three or four additional TIFF tags.<p>
However, in order for the information to be correctly exchanged between various
clients and providers of GeoTIFF, it is important to establish a common system
for describing map projections.<p>
In the TIFF/GeoTIFF framework, there are essentially three different spaces
upon which coordinate systems may be defined. The spaces are:<p>
</tt>
<pre>  1) The raster space (Image space) R, used to reference the pixel values
     in an image,
  2) The Device space D, and
  3) The Model space, M, used to reference points on the earth.</pre><tt><p>
In the sections that follow we shall discuss the relevance and use of each of
these spaces, and their corresponding coordinate systems, from the standpoint
of GeoTIFF.</tt>
<pre></pre><tt> </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="2.5.1">2.5.1 Device Space and GeoTIFF</a></h4>
<tt><p>
In standard TIFF 6.0 there are tags which relate raster space R with device
space D, such as monitor, scanner or printer. The list of such tags consists of
the following:<p>
</tt>
<pre>    ResolutionUnit (296)
    XResolution    (282)
    YResolution    (283)
    Orientation    (274)
    XPosition      (286)
    YPosition      (287)</pre><tt></tt>
<pre></pre><tt>In
Geotiff, provision is made to identify earth-referenced coordinate systems
(model space M) and to relate M space with R space. This provision is
independent of and can co-exist with the relationship between raster and device
spaces. To emphasize the distinction, this spec shall not refer to "X" and "Y"
raster coordinates, but rather to raster space "J" (row) and "I" (column)
coordinate variables instead, as defined in  <a href="geotiff2.5.html#2.5.2.2.">section 2.5.2.2.</a><p>
<p>

 <h4><a name="2.5.2">2.5.2 Raster Coordinate Systems</a></h4>
<tt> </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="2.5.2.1">2.5.2.1 Raster Data</a></h4>
<tt><p>
Raster data consists of spatially coherent, digitally stored numerical data,
collected from sensors, scanners, or in other ways numerically derived. The
manner in which this storage is implemented in a TIFF file is described in the
standard TIFF specification. <p>
<p>
Raster data values, as read in from a file, are organized by software into two
dimensional arrays, the indices of the arrays being used as coordinates. There
may also be additional indices for multispectral data, but these indices do not
refer to spatial coordinates but spectral, and so of not of concern here.<p>
<p>
Many different types of raster data may be georeferenced, and there may be
subtle ways in which the nature of the data itself influences how the
coordinate system (Raster Space) is defined for raster data. For example, pixel
data derived from imaging devices and sensors represent aggregate values
collected over a small, finite, geographic area, and so it is natural to define
coordinate systems in which the pixel value is thought of as filling an area.
On the other hand, digital elevations models may consist of discrete
"postings", which may best be considered as point measurements at the vertices
of a grid, and not in the interior of a cell. </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="2.5.2.2">2.5.2.2 Raster Space</a></h4>
<tt><p>
The choice of origin for raster space is not entirely arbitrary, and depends
upon the nature of the data collected. Raster space coordinates shall be
referred to by their pixel types, i.e., as "PixelIsArea" or "PixelIsPoint".<p>
<p>
Note: For simplicity, both raster spaces documented below use a fixed pixel
size and spacing of 1. Information regarding the visual representation of this
data, such as pixels with non-unit aspect ratios, scales, orientations, etc,
are best communicated with the TIFF 6.0 standard tags.<p>
<p>
 </tt>
<h4>
"PixelIsArea" Raster Space</h4>
<tt><p>
The "PixelIsArea" raster grid space R, which is the default, uses coordinates I
and J, with (0,0) denoting the upper-left corner of the image, and increasing I
to the right, increasing J down. The first pixel-value fills the square grid
cell with the bounds:<p>
</tt>
<pre>   top-left = (0,0), bottom-right = (1,1)</pre><tt><p>
and so on; by extension this one-by-one grid cell is also referred to as a
pixel. An N by M pixel image covers an are with the mathematically defined
bounds (0,0),(N,M).<p>
</tt>
<pre>     (0,0)
      +---+---+-&gt; I
      | * | * |
      +---+---+        Standard (PixelIsArea) TIFF Raster space R,
      | (1,1)  (2,1)      showing the areas (*) of several pixels.
      |
      J</pre><tt>
     <p>
 </tt>
<h4>
"PixelIsPoint" Raster Space</h4>
<tt><p>
The PixelIsPoint raster grid space R uses the same coordinate axis names as
used in PixelIsArea Raster space, with increasing I to the right, increasing J
down. The first pixel-value however, is realized as a point value located at
(0,0). An N by M pixel image consists of points which fill the mathematically
defined bounds (0,0),(N-1,M-1).<p>
</tt>
<pre>     (0,0)   (1,0)
      *-------*------&gt; I
      |       |
      |       |       PixelIsPoint TIFF Raster space R,
      *-------*         showing the location (*) of several pixels.
      |     (1,1)
      J</pre><tt><p>
If a point-pixel image were to be displayed on a display device with pixel
cells having the same size as the raster spacing, then the upper-left corner of
the displayed image would be located in raster space at (-0.5, -0.5). <p>
<p>
 </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="2.5.3">2.5.3 Model Coordinate Systems</a></h4>
<tt><p>
The following methods of describing spatial model locations (as opposed to
raster) are recognized in Geotiff: </tt>
<pre>	Geographic coordinates
	Geocentric coordinates
	Projected coordinates
	Vertical coordinates
</pre><tt>Geographic,
geocentric and projected coordinates are all imposed on models of the earth. To
describe a location uniquely, a coordinate set must be referenced to an
adequately defined coordinate system. If a coordinate system is from the
Geotiff standard definitions, the only reference required is the standard
coordinate system code/name. If the coordinate system is non-standard, it must
be defined. The required definitions are described below.<p>
<p>
Projected coordinates, local grid coordinates, and (usually) geographical
coordinates, form two dimensional horizontal coordinate systems (i.e.,
horizontal with respect to the earth's surface). Height is not part of these
systems. To describe a position in three dimensions it is necessary to consider
height as a second one dimensional vertical coordinate system.<p>
<p>
To georeference an image in GeoTIFF, you must specify a Raster Space coordinate
system, choose a horizontal model coordinate system, and a transformation
between these two, as will be described in  <a href="geotiff2.6.html#2.6">section 2.6</a><p>
<p>
 </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="2.5.3.1">2.5.3.1 Geographic Coordinate Systems</a></h4>
<tt><p>
Geographic Coordinate Systems are those that relate angular latitude and
longitude (and optionally geodetic height) to an actual point on the earth. The
process by which this is accomplished is rather complex, and so we describe the
components of the process in detail here.<p>
<p>
 </tt>
<h4>
Ellipsoidal Models of the Earth</h4>
<tt><p>
The geoid - the earth stripped of all topography - forms a reference surface
for the earth. However, because it is related to the earth's gravity field, the
geoid is a very complex surface; indeed, at a detailed level its description is
not well known. The geoid is therefore not used in practical mapping.<p>
<p>
It has been found that an oblate ellipsoid (an ellipse rotated about its minor
axis) is a good approximation to the geoid and therefore a good model of the
earth. Many approximations exist: several hundred ellipsoids have been defined
for scientific purposes and about 30 are in day to day use for mapping. The
size and shape of these ellipsoids can be defined through two parameters.
Geotiff requires one of these to be</tt>
<pre>          the semi-major axis (a), 
</pre><tt>and
the second to be either </tt>
<pre>          the inverse flattening (1/f) </pre><tt>or
</tt>
<pre>          the semi-minor axis (b).
</pre><tt>Historical
models exist which use a spherical approximation; such models are not
recommended for modern applications, but if needed the size of a model sphere
may be defined by specifying identical values for the semimajor and semiminor
axes; the inverse flattening cannot be used as it becomes infinite for perfect
spheres.<p>
Other ellipsoid parameters needed for mapping applications, for example the
square of the eccentricity, can easily be calculated by an application from the
two defining parameters. Note that Geotiff uses the modern geodesy convention
for the symbol (b) for the semi-minor axis. No provision is made for mapping
other planets in which a tri-dimensional (triaxial) ellipsoid might be
required, where (b) would represent the semi-median axis and (c) the semi-minor
axis.<p>
<p>
Numeric codes for ellipsoids regularly used for earth-mapping are included in
the Geotiff reference lists.<p>
<p>
 </tt>
<h4>
Latitude and Longitude</h4>
<tt><p>
The coordinate axes of the system referencing points on an ellipsoid are called
latitude and longitude. More precisely, <b>geodetic</b> latitude and longitude
are required in this Geotiff standard. A discussion of the several other types
of latitude and longitude is beyond the scope of this document as they are not
required for conventional mapping. <p>
<p>
Latitude is defined to be the angle subtended with the ellipsoid's equatorial
plane by a perpendicular through the surface of the ellipsoid from a point.
Latitude is positive if north of the equator, negative if south. <p>
<p>
Longitude is defined to be the angle measured about the minor (polar) axis of
the ellipsoid from a prime meridian (see below) to the meridian through a
point, positive if east of the prime meridian and negative if west. Unlike
latitude which has a natural origin at the equator, there is no feature on the
ellipsoid which forms a natural origin for the measurement of longitude. The
zero longitude can be any defined meridian. Historically, nations have used the
meridian through their national astronomical observatories, giving rise to
several prime meridians. By international convention, the meridian through
Greenwich, England is the standard prime meridian. Longitude is only
unambiguous if the longitude of its prime meridian relative to Greenwich is
given. Prime meridians other than Greenwich which are sometimes used for earth
mapping are included in the Geotiff reference lists.<p>
<p>
 </tt>
<h4>
Geodetic Datums</h4>
<tt><p>
As well as there being several ellipsoids in use to model the earth, any one
particular ellipsoid can have its location and orientation relative to the
earth defined in different ways. If the relationship between the ellipsoid and
the earth is changed, then the geographical coordinates of a point will
change.<p>
<p>
Conversely, for geographical coordinates to uniquely describe a location the
relationship between the earth and the ellipsoid must be defined.  This
relationship is described by a geodetic datum. An exact geodetic definition of
geodetic datums is beyond the current scope of Geotiff. However the Geotiff
standard requires that the geodetic datum being utilized be identified by
numerical code. If required, defining parameters for the geodetic datum can be
included as a citation.<p>
<p>
 </tt>
<h4>
Defining Geographic Coordinate Systems</h4>
<tt><p>
In summary, geographic coordinates are only unique if qualified by the code of
the geographic coordinate system to which they belong. A geographic coordinate
system has two axes, latitude and longitude, which are only unambiguous when
both of the related prime meridian and geodetic datum are given, and in turn
the geodetic datum definition includes the definition of an ellipsoid. The
Geotiff standard includes a list of frequently used geographic coordinate
systems and their component ellipsoids, geodetic datums and prime meridians.
Within the Geotiff standard a geographic coordinate system can be identified
either by </tt>
<pre>           the code of a standard geographic coordinate system</pre><tt>or
by</tt>
<pre>            a user-defined system.</pre><tt><p>
The user is expected to provide geographic coordinate system code/name,
geodetic datum code/name, ellipsoid code (if in standard) or ellipsoid name and
two defining parameters (a) and either (1/f) or (b), and prime meridian code
(if in standard) or name and longitude relative to Greenwich.<p>
<p>
 </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="2.5.3.2">2.5.3.2 Geocentric Coordinate Systems</a></h4>
<tt><p>
A geocentric coordinate system is a 3-dimensional coordinate system with its
origin at or near the center of the earth and with 3 orthogonal axes. The
Z-axis is in or parallel to the earth's axis of rotation (or to the axis around
which the rotational axis precesses). The X-axis is in or parallel to the plane
of the equator and passes through its intersection with the Greenwich meridian,
and the Y-axis is in the plane of the equator forming a right-handed coordinate
system with the X and Z axes.<p>
<p>
Geocentric coordinate systems are not frequently used for describing locations,
but they are often utilized as an intermediate step when transforming between
geographic coordinate systems. (Coordinate system transformations are described
in  <a href="geotiff2.6.html#2.6">section 2.6</a> below).<p>
<p>
In the Geotiff standard, a geocentric coordinate system can be identified,
either</tt>
<pre>	through the geographic code (which in turn implies a datum),</pre><tt>
or</tt>
<pre>	through a user-defined name.
</pre><tt><p>
 </tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="2.5.3.3">2.5.3.3 Projected Coordinate Systems</a></h4>
<tt><p>
Although a geographical coordinate system is mathematically two dimensional, it
describes a three dimensional object and cannot be represented on a plane
surface without distortion. Map projections are transformations of geographical
coordinates to plane coordinates in which the characteristics of the
distortions are controlled. A map projection consists of a coordinate system
transformation method and a set of defining parameters. A projected coordinate
system (PCS) is a two dimensional (horizontal) coordinate set which, for a
specific map projection, has a single and unambiguous transformation to a
geographic coordinate system. <p>
<p>
In GeoTIFF PCS's are defined using the POSC/EPSG system, in which the PCS
planar coordinate system, the Geographic coordinate system, and the
transformation between them, are broken down into simpler logical components.
Here are schematic formulas showing how the Projected Coordinate Systems and
Geographic Coordinates Systems are encoded:</tt>
<pre>
     Projected_CS  =  Geographic_CS + Projection
     Geographic_CS =  Angular_Unit + Geodetic_Datum + Prime_Meridian
     Projection    =  Linear Unit + Coord_Transf_Method + CT_Parameters 
     Coord_Transf_Method   = { TransverseMercator | LambertCC | ...}
     CT_Parameters = {OriginLatitude + StandardParallel+...}</pre><tt><p>
(See also the Reference Parameters documentation in  <a href="geotiff2.5.html#2.5.4">section 2.5.4</a>). <p>
Notice that "Transverse Mercator" is not referred to as a "Projection", but
rather as a "Coordinate Transformation Method"; in GeoTIFF, as in EPSG/POSC,
the word "Projection" is reserved for particular, well-defined systems in which
both the coordinate transformation method, its defining parameters, and their
linear units are established. <p>
<p>
Several tens of coordinate transformation methods have been developed. Many are
very similar and for practical purposes can be considered to give identical
results. For example in the Geotiff standard Gauss-Kruger and Gauss-Boaga
projection types are considered to be of the type Transverse Mercator. Geotiff
includes a listing of commonly used projection defining parameters.<p>
<p>
Different algorithms require different defining parameters. A future version of
Geotiff will include formulas for specific map projection algorithms
recommended for use with listed projection parameters.<p>
<p>
To limit the magnitude of distortions of projected coordinate systems, the
boundaries of usage are sometimes restricted. To cover more extensive areas,
two or more projected coordinate systems may be required. In some cases many of
the defining parameters of a set of projected coordinate systems will be held
constant. <p>
<p>
The Geotiff standard does not impose a strict hierarchy onto such zoned systems
such as US State Plane or UTM, but considers each zone to be a discrete
projected coordinate system; the ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey code value alone is
sufficient to identify the standard coordinate systems. <p>
<p>
Within the Geotiff standard a projected coordinate system can be identified
either by </tt>
<pre>        the code of a standard projected coordinate system </pre><tt>or
by</tt>
<pre>        a user-defined system. </pre><tt><p>
<p>
User-define projected coordinate systems may be defined by defining the
Geographic Coordinate System, the coordinate transformation method and its
associated parameters, as well as the planar system's linear units.<p>
</tt>
<img src="gifs/clrbar_half.gif">
 <h4><a name="2.5.3.4">2.5.3.4 Vertical Coordinate Systems</a></h4>
<tt><p>
Many uses of Geotiff will be limited to a two-dimensional, horizontal,
description of location for which geographic coordinate systems and projected
coordinate systems are adequate. If a three-dimensional description of location
is required Geotiff allows this either through the use of a geocentric
coordinate system or by defining a vertical coordinate system and using this
together with a geographic or projected coordinate system.<p>
<p>
In general usage, elevations and depths are referenced to a surface at or close
to the geoid. Through increasing use of satellite positioning systems the
ellipsoid is increasingly being used as a vertical reference surface. The
relationship between the geoid and an ellipsoid is in general not well known,
but is required when coordinate system transformations are to be executed.<p>

 The European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) has compiled and is
 distributing this set of parameters defining various geodetic
 and cartographic coordinate systems to encourage
 standardisation across the Exploration and Production segment
 of the oil industry.  The data is included as reference data
 in the Geotiff data exchange specification, in Iris21 the
 Petroconsultants data model, and in Epicentre, the POSC data
 model.  Parameters map directly to the POSC Epicentre model
 v2.0, except for data item codes which are included in the
 files for data management purposes.  Geodetic datum parameters
 are embedded within the geographic coordinate system file. 
 This has been done to ease parameter maintenance as there is a
 high correlation between geodetic datum names and geographic
 coordinate system names.  The Projected Coordinate System v2.0
 tabulation consists of systems associated with locally used
 projections.  Systems utilising the popular UTM grid system
 have also been included.
 
 Criteria used for material in these lists include:
